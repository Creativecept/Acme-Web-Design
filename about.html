                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>Creativecept Media courses are designed to help beginner programmers 
                    who want to learn web development technologies, or start a career in website development.
                    <br>
                    We respect your curiosity and passion for learning new things, 
                    that's why even though the tutorials are absolutely free, 
                    we're always striving hard for publishing the contents as comprehensive 
                    as possible without compromising the quality. We simply don't write tutorials 
                    just for increasing the page views and once you start learning, soon you'll realize that.
                </p>

                <p class="p-border">The cost of running and maintaining this website 
                    is covered by the revenue generated through advertisements, 
                    but we will always try to keep the number of ads as low as possible.
                    This guiding principle has made CRM Web Docs the go-to repository 
                    of independent information for developers, regardless of brand, 
                    browser or platform. We are an open community of devs, writers, 
                    and other technologists building resources for a better Web, 
                    with over 17 million monthly MDN users from all over the world. 
                    Anyone can contribute, and each of the 45,000 individuals who 
                    have done so over the past decades has strengthened and improved the resource. 
                    We also receive content contributions from our partners, including Microsoft, 
                    Google, Samsung, Igalia, W3C and others. Together we continue to drive innovation 
                    on the Web and serve the common good.
